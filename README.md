The Viking Game

## Questions and meeting points:
We need to decide how to utilize the time that the other AI spends processing. - Can we assume that this will be 10 seconds? 
^^ We need to think about making it a robust piece of software early - don't get too bogged down in algos - We are SET ^^ -(Andy Baker)
We need to be sure of the rules - ask questions such as can a pawn take a piece against 5,5 while the king is on it?
Optimization? Rapid prototyping in Java - what will final implementation be written in - C/C++ for optimization. Might have limitations on the VM - ie no JVM etc. So should be a compiled executable. Doesn't exclude much. 
Functional? - Haskell?? ;)
